                 One being "Lead Lab Instructor"
                 where in i had to teach undergrad students concepts and had to conduct tests based on the concepts taught.
                 Second being "Lab Tutor" wherein undergrad students from Computer Science will ask doubts regarding the problems and/or concepts that they are unable to solve/understand and i had to solve them.
                 Third role was to monitor the labs.

                         March 2019</p></h4>
                  <p>The project was developed using python, django.
                     Goal of this project was to develop a web application where users can search for people who are using github repos using their username.
		     The user of this web application should be a registered user, only then will he/she be able to use this functionality.
		     For getting the info of gitHub users i made use of REST calls to gitHub's API then collected the response back in JSON format.
	             parsed through the relevant JSON data so that only useful information can be shown to users who query for this info.
		     Also added functionality to track the last(most recent) searched github user by the customer for any new activity on github by that user and 
		     notify the customer.

                         October 2017 - December 2017</p></h4>
                  <p>This project was done in Advanced Artificial Intelligence Course taken in Master's program. The project was developed using c++.
                     Goal of this project was to develop an intelligent system that was capable of playing against each other i.e. both players being the system itself but equipped to use different algorithms to find & make the optimal move at each turn.
                     Main concepts used were Minmax-A-B and Alpha-Beta search algorithms.
                     This was used for  generating the trees for all possible combinations that a player can make and then select the optimal move based on the utility value that is assigned for each cell given by the utility function that was implemented.
                     The system was simulated to play against itself and for each simulation all combinations of algorithm was chosen for each player and the results were analysed.

                  <p>This project was done in Advanced Artificial intelligence Course taken in Master's program. The project was completely developed using c++.
                     Goal of this project was to develop an intelligent system that was capable of detecting the type of cancer a person might have depending on the symptoms that are selected by the person and then give a list of possible treatments.
                     It mainly used backward chaining and forward chaining algorithm concepts.
                     Backward chaining was used for detecting the type of cancer & forward chaining algorithm was applied to list the treatments.

                  </h4>
                  <p>This project was done in Graphical User Interface Course taken in Master's program.
                     The project was developed using Qt Creator and OpenGL. The aim of this was to develop a user
                     interface to simulate cache system based on the user input, i.e. by taking user inputs like
                     the type of replacement policy(LRU/LFU/Random), Cache Type(Instruction/Data Cache), and also giving
                     user an option to select the number of ways, sets, bytes per block; memory size.
                     There was also an option for    user to input a file called Trace file that contains a list of
                     hexadecimal memory addresses for the system to simulate and record number of cache hits and cache miss.

                  	 Used Spring MVC to develop the project.
                  	 View was implemented using Html and Jsp. Form validations was done using JavaScript.
                  	 Data was maintained using MySql.
                  	 Application was deployed on Apache Tomcat Server platform.

                  </h4>
                  <p>The simplest means of determining a student's skill level is the method
                     employed in CAT (computerized adaptive testing). As the test proceeds, the computer adjusts
                     the subject’s score based on their answers, continuously fine-tuning the score by selecting questions
                     from a narrower range of difficulty. This application was deployed on cloud platform called open-shift
                     and the web pages will be deployed using HTML/JSP, JavaScript for validation and the database will be
                     maintained using MySql and the server will be Tomcat. Also Internet connection is required for the successful
                     execution of this application.

                         Oct 2014 - Dec 2014</p>
                  </h4>
                  <p>This project is aimed to automate the operations of Mobile Service Providers. There are many websites available
                    which gives details for each mobile server. But all these details that too for all mobile service provider of different
                    region is not present in one single place. So main objective of this portal will be to bring together all the details
                    and make it easily available for the user. It will be available for both prepaid and postpaid services providing their
                    specific details. This system is a browser which is completely related to Internet browsing. This allows for
                    multi-divisional, multi- department system handling that includes various services. In this system windows 7 is used
                    as operating system; html, php, css for user interface; php, mysql for programming
